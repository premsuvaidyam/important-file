    <h2>PARENTS-TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</h2>
    <P class=" war"> ALUMNI ASSOCIATION: A Bond of Love Years of blissful togetherness and then came a horde of painful goodbyes. Friends, and classmates who couldn’t do without each other, who had grown up on each other’s laughter and love, were now forced to go their separate ways, to seek a new life. Like clay, these girls were moulded from endearing toddlers to enterprising citizens of society by their Alma Mater, ready to face the world, their souls having been made strong and pure. These ex-Notre Dame students firmly believe in taking concrete measures to uphold the values of gratitude and humility instilled in them and serve the school that has laid the foundation of their entity. The Alumni Association of NDA is truly a heart-warming group meant for students who have passed out of the school and are leading lives in different corners of the world, despite which they take time off to reconnect with old acquaintances and schoolmates and organize constructive programmes for the students from time to time. The members keep in touch, besides meeting at regular intervals. They also organize tuck shops and other sessions, all of which are an absolute delight for us, besides having pooled in generously to donate computers to the Julie School, widening horizons for those underprivileged children considerably. They are also great pillars of support and strength for the school in times of crisis, such as natural disasters. These ladies- some teachers, some engineers, some doctors, some homemakers, and more with lives and responsibilities of their own – are truly an inspiration for the students. The kind of loyalty and love that they have imbibed after years of learning and experience from their Alma Mater, so rare in today’s era, spurs all of us to maintain the bonds we have established with our school.</P>
