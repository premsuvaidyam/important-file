    <h2>PARENTS-TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</h2>
    <div class="mon">
        <p>Synonymous with selfless service and unstinted devotion, the Parents-Teachers Association, or the PTA, as it is popularly known, is one of NDA’s strongest pillars of support, consistently making efforts to nurture the inherent talents and inborn skills of our students. Elected through the Annual General Body Meeting (AGM), it comprises dedicated parents, teachers, and staff members, who have, over the years, provided us with numerous opportunities to test our skills and hone our talents. Through grand debates, JAM sessions, and story-writing competitions, they’ve encouraged us to tap our critical and creative potential. From rangoli-making to salad- dressing, it is truly heartening to see that they make it a point to award every student for her efforts in the competitions. Their Annual Book Fair is an absolute treat while the various inter- school events do much to instil in us a sense of camaraderie and spirit. They truly believe in nurturing the women of today, who walk strong and tall but remain grounded and true to their roots. The PTA is a great inspiration, toiling and persevering consistently, to help create a better, more conscientious world. Their efforts are sure to mould us into women our school will be proud of some day.
