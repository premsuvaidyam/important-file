   <h1>MAMAS OF NOTRE DAME</h1>
   <div class="monster">
   <p> Smiles that never die, eyes that never lose their sparkle, hands that never fail to support, and hearts that never cease to love unconditionally – every Indian mother is a beautiful incarnation of God who could not be everywhere.</p>
   <p>Embodying that very spirit and selflessness, the Mama’s Club is a heart-warming example of how fortunate all of us members of the Notre Dame family are to have mothers, who stand firm behind us through thick and thin.</p>
   <p>The May Day celebrations gain their charm by the mama’s generous contribution, and every Children’s Day is virtually incomplete without their delicious snacks. The Mama’s Club has always made laudable efforts to support NDA in all its endeavours, be it financially or culturally. These ladies take time off their busy schedules to organize interesting activities and sessions for us at regular intervals. They’ve shown us students that a mother is always a valuable asset for society, knowing her responsibilities and setting examples for us to follow through their conduct, besides being the greatest source of encouragement and affection in our lives.</p>
