    <h2> ST.JULIE’S FAVOURITES</h2>
    <h2> JULIE SCHOOL</h2>
    <div class="top2">
    <p>God created all men equal. We are all one, and so we deserve to be. It is a matter of great regret that in certain remote corners of the globe, worlds prevail of dark, miserable obscurity, worlds of deprivation and tears and scores of unfulfilled desires of people, who are, in no way, inferior to us.</p>
    <p>One of NDA’s greatest initiatives, Julie School, is a ray of hope for those underprivileged children who deserve to be one of us. Started with minimal resources, it has today grown to a larger school with    students attached to the main branch of Notre Dame Academy.</p>
    <p>Opening of Julie School was a project dear to the daughters of Saint Julie, whose first priority was always the poor. On april8, 1987, Julie school opened with a prayer service. Initially, the children were given a room in the main school. Later, this proved to be inadequate, and a one-floor building was constructed next to Julie Hall. Subsequently, from funds raised by fetes and the hard work of the main school children, a second and then a third floor were added. Classes are taught from kindergarten to Std VIII.  According to the Bihar Board syllabus. Today the enrolment is around   </p>
    <p>Moral Values are always stressed. The children are taught English, Hindi, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science, besides G.K. in the higher classes. The Sisters and the students of Notre Dame also provide them with clothes, stationery, and food items, which can enable them to lead healthy, happy lives.</p>
    <p>Julie School celebrates Sports Days, Teacher’s days, Children’s Days, and organizes cultural activities to help children tap their hidden potential. The students are also awarded perfect attendance and excellence in academics and other spheres. Under the able guidance of their headmistress, Sr. Mary Mallika, there is a consistent effort to improve life for these children and quicken the process of their integration into the mainstream of the society. In fact, after finishing Std. VII, many are absorbed in well- recognised high schools in Patnap</p>

    <p> In the remotest corners of the globe, tiny feet trudge along every day looking for work before they can even learn to match steps with the rest of the world, where tender hands are subjected to arduous labour before they can even master the art of writing their own names, in a world of deprivation, misfortune, tears, and laments.</p>
    <p>One of NDA’s finest Social Service Projects, “Balchandra” has emerged as a ray of hope for those underprivileged or street children who deserve to be one of us. Starting in 1997 with only three students, it has today grown into 300 children attached to the main branch of Notre Dame Academy.</p>
    <p> It comprises of students in two age groups, one is the age group of 6-10 years (studying in UKG, LKG, and Std. I) and the other is the age group of 10-14 years (studying in Std. II- Std. IV). These children belong to the slum area adjoining the school and are absolutely deprived of all that is essential to lead a life of minimal dignity and self-respect. Some are even physically impaired.</p>
    <p>Laying the necessary stress on good morals through singing and story- telling, the students are also taught English, Hindi, and Mathematics. They are provided with stationary, carpets to sit on, toiletries, and food items, besides woolens and other gifts by generous donors, all of which enable them to lead a healthy, happy life.</p>
    <p>Balchandra also participates in painting competitions, spelling competitions (both Hindi and English), and celebrates Sport’s Days and Teacher’s Days, organizing cultural activities to help the children tap their hidden potential. Sweets and gifts are distributed for every festival. The students are also awarded for perfect attendance, excellence in academics, and other spheres.</p>
    <p>Their ‘guardian angel’, Mrs. Reena Verma, has striven consistently to improve life for them and quicken the process of their integration into the mainstream of society. The school staff, students, and Sister have also extended their support and encouragement. Now highly successful and a great inspiration, the School is truly setting exemplary standards to Implement the idea of ‘Each One, Teach One’ as envisaged by the National Literacy Mission. </p>
