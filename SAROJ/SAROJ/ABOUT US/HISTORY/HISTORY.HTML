    <P> Indeed, that is what has happened when we trace the history of  Notre Dame Academy in Patna. We recall the time of the first days when our Sisters went around in the small bus from Jamalpur ringing a bell and announcing the opening of classes at 184 Patliputra Colony. Only 29 children could be counted at the end of the first year, 1960. Today we receive at least ten times more registrations that we can handle in a year’s time. The saga of the acorn seems to have unfolded rapidly. Around 3,000 students attend our school currently, and with the addition of a fourth section in 2007, the number will keep on increasing.</P>

    <h1 class="boner"> EARLY GROWTH</h1>
    <div class="boners"><p>Our beginnings were very humble. The pioneers, Sisters Mary Freda and Sushila, stayed in a rented house at 184 Patliputra Colony which also had space for new classrooms. School was opened on February 2, 1960, with only nine students on the registration list: six girls and three boys. Just three of these students attended classes on the first day – the sisters, Mira and Padma Jha, and Joey Boy. The others had no idea that the school would be actually ready at this time.</p>
        
        <p> The school calendar began in January in those days. At the end of 1961, the enrolment was 24 boys and 22 girls. At the end 1962, there were 170 children: 96 boys and 74 girls. By the end of 1964, there were 390 students: 198 boys and 192 girls. After that, there was no looking back, and the numbers increased from year to year, with the girls quickly overtaking the boys.</p>
      <p> By January, 1961, a new principal had been appointed in the person of Sister Mary Delrey. With her arrived Sister Karuna for K.G.B, Sister Vimala for office work and part-time teaching, and Sister Pratima for K.G.A. The lay teachers then were Mrs Verma, Miss V. Ekka, Mrs. Diffey, and Miss Sylvester.</p>
      <p>As the school building in Patliputra colony was finally reaching completion, January 26, 1962, was chosen as General Moving Day. The west wing was ready for occupancy for Stds. 2, 3, and 4. The administration wing was not ready as yet. So the principal’s desk and chair was placed in front of the girls bathroom where the water cooler is at present.</p>
      <p> February 2, 1962, was the celebration of the first Notre Dame Academy, a very simple in comparison with our present standards. Each class received some sweets and a gift of a toy or an educational teaching aid.</p>
      <p> We take the main gate in front of our school for granted. It is always there to greet us when we come and to bid farewell to us when we go. It was set in place on February 3, 1962. The design is that of a sun-burst, with many rays radiating from the centre, mounted by the traditional ND monogram.</p>
      <p> The official opening of the school library was on March 13, 1962, with only 100 books. Mother Mary St. Thomas officiated at the ceremony. Today our library holds some 25,000 books.</p>
      <p> Laying of the cornerstone: April 7, 1962, was of great significance to us as His Excellency, Rt.  Rev. Augustine Wildermuth, S.J., laid the cornerstone for the school on the left side of the main door of the school. Prominent guests from Patna made the occasion a very special one. Another article in the souvenir gives all the details of the auspicious event.</p>
      <p> November 18, 1962, saw another first with the First Parents’ Day. Along with this, there was a sewing and craft display which the parents and guardians appreciated very much.</p>
      <p> The First Sports Day took place on October 18, 1963, and was the occasion for the Notre Dame students to make their debut in public. The student Council came into existence on February 11, 1965, with representatives from Stds.3 and 4 also being inducted into it. Sister Laurette, the principal at that time, presided over the function.</p>
      <p> Another mega event was the inspection by Mr. A. J. Barrows, Secretary of the Indian School Certificate Council, on August 25th and 26th, 1965. He assured us the recognition by ISC. This recognition came soon after his visit.</p>
      <p> The opening of the Montessori House of Children was on January 14, 1968. Sister Pratima was made directress with only fifteen tot at the beginning. One only has to look at the numbers today to see the rate of growth that has taken place.</p>
      <h1 class="boner"> FUTURE GROWTH</h1>
      <P> And so the stage was gradually set for further advancement and development. Seeing that the further CBSE syllabus was more in line with government policy, we opted to join this National Board for the correction of exams at the end of high school. In March, 1990, the first Stds. 10 and 12 appeared for their Board exams and received excellent results.</P>
      <P> The present Julie hall was officially inaugurated on November 11, 1989, with a prayer service and a blessing given by Father James Cox, SJ. A music relating the story of Ali Baba and the forty thieves with an ingenious slant was held on November 12th and 13th 1989. Before this, we had to make do with an open air arrangement. Now around 1,800 students could be seated in the hall in all types of weather, still not quite big enough for our needs.</P>
      <P> The opening of Julie school was a project dear to the daughters of Saint Julie, whose first priority was always the poor. On April 8, 1987, Julie School opened with a prayer service. On January 20, 1988, there was a second beginning with a full-fledged teacher, Miss Savita Singh, and sister Jesslin in charge. On February 29, 1988, there was a formal inauguration of the school. Patna Mid-Town Round Table 58 had agreed to bear the cost of running Julie school. Mr. R. Chandra Shekher, President of the Round Table, Delhi, graced the occasion. Initially, the children were given a room in the main school children, a second and the a third floor was added . Classes are taught from kindergarden to Std. VII according to the Bihar Board syllabus. Today the enrolment is around 460, almost all of them are girls.</P>
      <P>The Bal Chandra mushroomed in 1998 after Sister Cyril, a loretto run from Kolkata, introduced us to the idea of ‘rainbow children’. These children are street children or children who have jobs but can’t afford to go to school. They come to Notre Dame Academy for two periods each day and learn the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic from Mrs. Reena Verma, the school librarian, and selected teachers and girls. The Bal Chandra used to hold their classes in the lobby next to the Montessori building, but now they have been housed comfortably in the Julie School.</P>
      <P> The 1990’s and the early 2000’s continued to see a steady growth and development. In  April, 2007 a fourth section of Std. 1 was opened as a gift to the people of patna in view of the coming Golden Jubilee. Steady streams of parents were vying with their daughters to get their ‘precious little daughters’ into our Academy. Perhaps this move of increasing the classes by one section yearly would prove to be a little compensation for them.</P>
      <h1 class="boner"> IN CONCLUSION</h1>
      <P> At the end of it all, we can say that countless people have contributed to the expansion and progress of Notre Dame Academy:</P>
      <P> ~All our provincials - Sr. Mary St. Thomas, Sr.Amala, Sr.Shobhana, Sr.Sharan, Sr.Anima, and Sr.Sreeja ,and Sr. Beena</P>
      <P> ~All our principals- Sr. Mary Freda, Sr.Delrey, Sr.Laurette, Sr.Peter Claver, Sr.Shobhana, Sr.Kripa, Sr.Jaya,Sr. Beena,Sr Jayshree, Sr. Tessy, </P>
