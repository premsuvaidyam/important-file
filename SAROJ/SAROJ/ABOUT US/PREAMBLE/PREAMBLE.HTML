    <p>R.N.P.S. is a Catholic institution managed by the Patna Notre Dame Sisters Society. Therefore all decisions of the Governing Body find their source in Christian philosophy and theology.<br>
        <br>
        R.N.P.S. traces its origin to its spiritual mother , St. Julie Billiart of France , who founded the congregation of the Sisters of&nbsp; Notre Dame de Namur in 1804. Her charismatic spirit of finding God’s goodness in everything was handed over to our own foundress , Sister AloysiaWolbring , who founded the Congregation of the Sisters of Notre Dame in Coesfeld , Germany , in 1850.<br>
        <br>
        Urged by the charism of St. Julie and Sister Aloysia , Notre Dame has established foundations throughout the world . The institution gives witness to God’s love by involvement in various educational, social and medical services in Germany , Italy , England , Holland , United States , South America , Indonesia , India , Korea , Papua New Guinea , Africa , the Philippines , China and Vietnam.<br>
        <br>
        The first Notre Dame school in India was founded in Jamalpur , Bihar , in 1950.<strong> In Patna , Notre Dame Academy was founded in 1960</strong>. Today , Notre Dame institutions are established in the states of Bihar , Jharkhand , Chhatisgarh , Karnataka , West Bengal , Delhi , Tamil Nadu , Jammu &amp; Kashmir , Assam , Kerala , Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>The aim of Notre Dame education is to train young people for unselfish leadership so that the students we educate will be able to change the oppressive structures of society by standing for justice and human rights. They are “to assist their fellow citizens in directing their lives to God in faith” by helping , healing , reconciling , and taking firm stand on moral principles of honesty , integrity , hard work and freedom.<br>
        <br>
        The parents and guardians are expected to be active participants in training their children in the moral and spiritual values which the school tries to foster.</strong></p>
